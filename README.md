[![Release](https://jitpack.io/v/tmurakami/splitcompat-weaver-gradle-plugin.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#tmurakami/splitcompat-weaver-gradle-plugin)

A Gradle plugin that weaves [`SplitCompat.install`](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/play/core/splitcompat/SplitCompat.html#install(android.content.Context)) into your
Activities and Services.

Applying this plugin, `SplitCompat.install` will be inserted after
calling `super.attachBaseContext` in your Activities or Services, as
shown below:

```java
@Override
protected void attachBaseContext(Context newBase) {
    super.attachBaseContext(newBase);
    SplitCompat.install(this); // This line will be added by this plugin.
}
```

## Installation

First, add the following into your root `build.gradle`:

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        google()
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.4.0' // requires 3.4.0+
        classpath 'com.github.tmurakami:splitcompat-weaver-gradle-plugin:0.1.0'
    }
}
```

Next, add `com.google.android.play:core` artifact as an `api` scoped
dependency into your base module's `build.gradle`:

```
api 'com.google.android.play:core:1.4.1' // requires 1.4.1+
```

Finally, apply this plugin in your Dynamic Feature Module's `build.gradle`:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'com.android.dynamic-feature'
apply plugin: 'com.github.tmurakami.splitcompat-weaver'
```

## Limitations

- This plugin only affects the Activities and Services contained in your
module to which it is applied. The classes in the libraries on which
that module relies won't be rewritten.
